 * AI advanced search business logic. Turns a free-text sentence into the same

 * unchanged. No HTTP here — the controller owns request/response.
 *
 * The model only ever EXTRACTS structured intent (`generateObject` with a strict
 * schema); it never sees the database. Location is resolved deterministically
 * server-side via `resolvePlace`, so a hallucinated suburb degrades to a plain
 * keyword rather than a bogus region filter.

// the output past the cap. 2000 leaves comfortable headroom.
