/**
 * Server-side "what am I looking at?" narrator for the floating guide character.
 *
 * Unlike the full chat assistant (streaming, tool-using), this returns ONE short
 * spoken line for the page in focus — grounded in real facts the route resolves
 * itself (it fetches the listing by id, never trusting client-supplied claims).
 * When a listing is an auction it leans into timing + how auctions work; for a
 * normal listing it highlights what's special and one honest read on value.
 *
 * The character should never be mute: when AI isn't configured (or errors), a
 * deterministic template built from the same facts is returned instead.
 */

/**
 * The spoken line itself is short, but the configured model is a "thinking"
 * model (e.g. Gemini Flash) whose reasoning can't be disabled on this endpoint
 * and is billed against the output budget. Too tight a cap truncates mid-answer
 * (or leaks reasoning), so we leave generous headroom for reasoning + the reply
 * and ask for minimal reasoning effort to keep it fast and cheap.
