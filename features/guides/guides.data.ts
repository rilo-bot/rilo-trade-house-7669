  {
    q: "Do I have to pay a letting fee?",
    a: "No. Charging tenants a letting fee to secure a rental has been banned in New Zealand since December 2018.",

  {
    q: "How often can my rent go up?",
    a: "At most once every 12 months, and your landlord must give you written notice in advance. Rent usually can't be increased during a fixed term unless the agreement specifically allows it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a fixed-term and periodic tenancy?",
    a: "A fixed-term runs for a set period (for example 12 months) and ends on an agreed date. A periodic tenancy continues until either party gives proper notice. The notice rules differ, so check which one you're signing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my landlord turn up whenever they like?",

    q: "How do I get my bond back?",
    a: "At the end of your tenancy you and your landlord agree on the refund and apply to Tenancy Services to release it. Leaving the place clean and undamaged — and having your move-in photos — makes this straightforward.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if there's a dispute with my landlord?",
