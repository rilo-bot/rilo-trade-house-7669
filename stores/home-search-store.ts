 * `/properties` — even though the two components sit far apart in the tree.
 *
 * Holds only the URL query STRING (client UI state); the listings themselves
 * are server data fetched by the grid via the API. Scoped to the home page by
 * `HomeSearchStoreProvider` (see stores/home-search-store-provider.tsx).
